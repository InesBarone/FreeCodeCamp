                <p class="text">Many works, famous in their version for orchestra, have been initially written for the piano. Some examples are the Hungarian Dances by Johannes Brahms, Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky, Gymnopedias by Erik Satie or A Song of Spring by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.</p>
        
                <p class="text">Conversely, many works from the classical repertoire have been transcribed for the piano, such as Franz Liszt's transcriptions of Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies or fantasies on opera themes. The piano is widely used in music to accompany the voice in choirs, lieder and melodies. It is also used in chamber music, in duet with another instrument, which is usually the violin or flute, in trios, quartets or quintets with piano.</p>
        
                <p class="text">The piano is the pedagogical instrument par excellence because it is a polyphonic, polyrhythmic and simple-to-use instrument, relatively cheap and quite loud. For this reason, it is used in most solfeggio classes in music schools and conservatories as the main instrument of the pedagogue.</p>

Today they can also be made of metal or gut wound with aluminium, silver or steel; the string in me, the sharpest - called cantino - is directly a steel thread, and, occasionally, gold.

The origin of the battery is located in the United States at the end of the 19th century and lies in the union, in 1890, of a few instruments that were played separately until now: the snare drum, the bass drum and the cymbals, popularized by the European music but all of Turkish origin.</p>

                <code><strong>Compass:</strong> The space located between two division lines is called compass, its duration is determined by the fraction that complements the first one.</code><br>
                <code><strong>Key:</strong> Determines where the notes and their names are located, in this case the note is G because the key begins on the second line.</code><br>
                <code><strong>Values:</strong> Due to the fact that the sounds vary in duration, a mathematical relationship between them is established for their use in musical writing.</code><br>
                <code><strong>Notes:</strong>Musical notes are used in musical notation to represent the height and relative duration of a sound, often using the meaning "musical figure".</code>
